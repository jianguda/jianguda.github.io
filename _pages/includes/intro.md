Hi, I am Jian. Currently, I work at [Monash University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monash_University) as a PhD candidate, under the supervision of [Prof. Aldeida Aleti](https://users.monash.edu.au/~aldeidaa/), [Prof. Chunyang Chen](https://chunyang-chen.github.io/), and [Prof. Hongyu Zhang](https://sites.google.com/site/hongyujohn/).

I was working as a PhD candidate (research assistant) at [University of Zurich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Zurich), supervised by [Prof. Harald C. Gall](https://www.ifi.uzh.ch/en/seal/people/gall.html).
Before that, I obtained my master's degree in machine learning, at [KTH Royal Institute of Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KTH_Royal_Institute_of_Technology), supervised by [Prof. Martin Monperrus](https://www.monperrus.net/martin/).
Further, I completed the bachelor's study in computer science (the elite class), at [Shandong University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shandong_University), supervised by [Prof. Jun Ma](https://ir.sdu.edu.cn/~junma/~junma_en.htm).

My research investigates the interplay between software engineering and machine learning, focusing on how engineering principles may guide targeted repairs to language models (LMs), namely __[LM Repair](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10752650)__. Meanwhile, I work on the underlying mechanism, which is the inherit semantic property of LMs, termed __[LM Semantics]()__. For academic inquiries, please contact me via email.

<!-- I have published 10+ papers <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=QT52p4QAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?logo=Google%20Scholar&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.jsdelivr.net%2Fgh%2Fjianguda%2Fjianguda.github.io@google-scholar-stats%2Fgs_data_shieldsio.json&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a> at the top international AI conferences such as NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, KDD. -->
