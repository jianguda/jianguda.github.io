Hi, I am Jian Gu. Currently, I work at [Monash University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monash_University) as a PhD candidate, under the supervision of [Prof. Aldeida Aleti](https://users.monash.edu.au/~aldeidaa/), [Prof. Chunyang Chen](https://chunyang-chen.github.io/), and [Prof. Hongyu Zhang](https://sites.google.com/site/hongyujohn/). I have all requirements completed; degree conferral pending.

I was working as a PhD candidate (research assistant) at [University of Zurich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Zurich), supervised by [Prof. Harald C. Gall](https://www.ifi.uzh.ch/en/seal/people/gall.html).
Before that, I obtained my master's degree in machine learning, at [KTH Royal Institute of Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KTH_Royal_Institute_of_Technology), supervised by [Prof. Martin Monperrus](https://www.monperrus.net/martin/).
Further, I completed the bachelor's study in computer science (the elite class), at [Shandong University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shandong_University), supervised by [Prof. Jun Ma](https://ir.sdu.edu.cn/~junma/~junma_en.htm).

My research investigates the interplay between software engineering and machine learning, focusing on how engineering principles may guide targeted repairs to language models (LMs), namely __[LM Repair](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10752650)__. Meanwhile, I work on the underlying mechanism, which is the inherit semantic property of LMs, termed __[LM Semantics]()__. For academic inquiries, please contact me via email.
